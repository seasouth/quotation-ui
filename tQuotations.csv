Commentary #001120 - 11/20/2000
National Bible Week: Celebrating God's Word I

A small group of businessmen met in New York City in 1940 to talk about faith in the face of an impending crisis. World War II was raging in  Europe, and it appeared to be only a matter of time before America would be involved. These businessmen believed they had to do something to help strengthen the nation spiritually.

""What can we do?"" they asked. Well, after much deliberation, they agreed that Bible-reading was crucially important. After all, the Bible had proven to be a source of hope and encouragement to countless millions over the centuries.

So they announced the first National Bible Week, to be observed December 8-15, 1941, and their first nationwide broadcast was scheduled  on NBC Radio for December 7.

The timing was providential, for just before that broadcast, news of the bombing of Pearl Harbor flashed around the world. There were few details, but America was glued to their radios as the National Bible Week broadcast began. Initially scheduled for one hour, with a comedy to follow, NBC scrubbed the comedy and allowed the National Bible Week broadcast to continue.",,,25

,"Charles",,"Colson","For liberal secularism, it's an article of faith that within the sexual realm, anything consenting adults agree to is morally acceptable. But Christianity teaches that God intended sexual relations to serve both a unitive and procreative function within the bonds of marriage. Pornography corrupts because it undermines our capacity to understand sexual relations as anything other than self-gratification.  It teaches us to regard our own bodies and the bodies of others as mere instruments of sexual pleasure -- that is, sex objects. Ultimately, pornography leads to sexuality that is impulsive, selfish, out of control. In the name of freedom, it enslaves people to their own basest desires.

Intellectually honest defenders of an alleged ""right"" to pornography admit that porn damages the interests of non-users and harms the community. Liberal philosopher Ronald Dworkin writes that access to porn ""sharply limits the ability of parents to bring about a cultural structure . . . in which sexual experience generally has dignity and beauty."" Even worse, pornographic fantasies lead to real-world horrors:  the abuse and exploitation of women and children.

This is why we need to work for laws to combat pornography. We shouldn't let the multi-billion dollar porn industry get away with claiming that we're simply prudes or neurotics. We must make the argument that pornography corrupts  our children and degrades our entire culture, dangerous to the common good.

And closer to home, we must warn our kids that consuming pornography makes it harder for them to become good husbands, wives, and parents.",2001,"BreakPoint with Charles Colson, Commentary #011212 - 12/12/2001, Sex and Sensibility: Protecting the Moral Ecology",,"Pornography",,44

His naturalism and emphasis on constructive imagination were harbingers of important intellectual turns on both sides of the Atlantic. He was a naturalist before naturalism grew popular; he appreciated multiple perfections before multiculturalism became an issue; he thought of philosophy as literature before it became a theme in American and European scholarly circles; and he managed to naturalize Platonism, update Aristotle, fight off idealisms, and provide a striking and sensitive account of the spiritual life without being a religious believer.",,204

1. Learn to work with just enough data, aiming for most of what you need (70%) instead of gunning for near certainty (90%).
2. Get comfortable with uncertainty by staying flexible after the decision is made. ""Many decisions are reversible, two-way doors,"" he said. For those decisions that can be easily undone, use ""a light-weight process."" He wrote that you can tell if it's a lightweight decision by answering the question ""So what if you're wrong?""
3. Instead of focusing on avoiding mistakes by making perfect decisions, become a master of ""quickly recognizing and correcting bad decisions. If you're good at course correcting, being wrong may be less costly than you think, whereas being slow is going to be expensive for sure.""
4. Finally, for the biggies -- those decisions that are not reversible or that have a big effect on customers, employees, or partners -- turn the idea of buy-in/approval on its head. Go with ""disagree and commit. If you have conviction on a particular direction even though there's no consensus, it's helpful to say, 'Look, I know we disagree on this but will you gamble with me on it?

,"G","K","Chesterton","In the matter of reforming things, as distinct from deforming them, there is one plain and simple principle; a principle which will probably be called a paradox. There exists in such a case a certain institution or law; let us say, for the sake of simplicity, a fence or gate erected across a road. The more modern type of reformer goes gaily up to it and says, ""I don’t see the use of this; let us clear it away."" To which the more intelligent type of reformer will do well to answer: ""If you don’t see the use of it, I certainly won’t let you clear it away. Go away and think. Then, when you can come back and tell me that you do see the use of it, I may allow you to destroy it.""

This paradox rests on the most elementary common sense. The gate or fence did not grow there. It was not set up by somnambulists who built it in their sleep. It is highly improbable that it was put there by escaped lunatics who were for some reason loose in the street. Some person had some reason for thinking it would be a good thing for somebody. And until we know what the reason was, we really cannot judge whether the reason was reasonable. It is extremely probable that we have overlooked some whole aspect of the question, if something set up by human beings like ourselves seems to be entirely meaningless and mysterious. There are reformers who get over this difficulty by assuming that all their fathers were fools; but if that be so, we can only say that folly appears to be a hereditary disease. But the truth is that nobody has any business to destroy a social institution until he has really seen it as an historical institution. If he knows how it arose, and what purposes it was supposed to serve, he may really be able to say that they were bad purposes, or that they have since become bad purposes, or that they are purposes which are no longer served. But if he simply stares at the thing as a senseless monstrosity that has somehow sprung up in his path, it is he and not the traditionalist who is suffering from an illusion.",,"The Thing: Why I Am A Catholic",,,,671

Full context:
Seeing that Zeus grants lordship to the Persian people, and to you, Cyrus, among them, let us, after reducing Astyages, depart from the little and rugged land which we possess and occupy one that is better. There are many such lands on our borders, and many further distant. If we take one of these, we will all have more reasons for renown. It is only reasonable that a ruling people should act in this way, for when will we have a better opportunity than now, when we are lords of so many men and of all Asia?”

Cyrus heard them, and found nothing to marvel at in their design; “Go ahead and do this,” he said; “but if you do so, be prepared no longer to be rulers but rather subjects. Soft lands breed soft men; wondrous fruits of the earth and valiant warriors grow not from the same soil.

I have hinted before in these chapters that the cause of all our human miseries is a radical moral dislocation, an upset in our relation to God and to each other. For whatever else the Fall may have been, it was most certainly a sharp change in man’s relation to his Creator. He adopted toward God an altered attitude, and by so doing destroyed the proper Creatorcreature relation in which, unknown to him, his true happiness lay. Essentially salvation is the restoration of a right relation between man and his Creator, a bringing back to normal of the Creator-creature relation.",,"Pursuit of God, Chapter 8, first two paragraphs after the verse",,,,725

Sin wants to remain unknown. It shuns the light. In the darkness of the unexpressed it poisons the whole being of a person. This can happen even in the midst of a pious community. In confession the light of the Gospel breaks into the darkness and seclusion of the heart. The sin must be brought into the light. The unexpressed must be openly spoken and acknowledged.

Another effective strategy is to ""wait to worry."" If something went wrong and you feel compelled to worry, don’t do this immediately. Instead, postpone your worry...
